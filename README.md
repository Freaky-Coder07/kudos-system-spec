# Kudos System – Spec-Driven Design

# Overview

This repository contains the specification for a Kudos System designed for Datacom’s internal employee portal.
The system allows employees to recognise their colleagues through short public messages of appreciation.

This project follows a spec-driven development approach, where all requirements, design decisions, and implementation plans are defined before any coding begins.

Demonstrate structured planning over ad-hoc coding

# Features (Planned)

# Development Approach

This project uses spec-driven development, which means:
